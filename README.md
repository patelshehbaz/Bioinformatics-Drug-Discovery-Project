# Bioinformatics-Drug-Discovery-Project

In this Project I will show you how to download and pre-process biological activity data from the ChEMBL database that you can use to perform Computational Drug Discovery. The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest.

The [_ChEMBL Database_](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) is a database that contains curated bioactivity data of more than 2 million compounds. It is compiled from more than 76,000 documents, 1.2 million assays and the data spans 13,000 targets and 1,800 cells and 33,000 indications.
